a. 2x2 is not solvable, because no matter where you place a queen, there are
   no other places where you can place a queen and have the other one solve
   this case.

b. 3x3 is also not solvable, for the same reasons above.

c. 4x4 is solvable, and it has two solutions; the solutions were found through
   testing all the positions using the method of moving in a L shaped manner,
   and checking if any of the queens can attack each other.

d. 5x5 is solvable, and has more than two solutions through testing with the
   same method above.

e. 6x6 is also solvable, but has exactly 4 solutions through testing, that don't
   involve just rotating the board around.

f. 7x7 is solvable as well, and has at least five solutions. 

g. 8x8 is also solvable, and has at least one solutions as well. (This one
   became quite large to test.)


Notes: The amount of solutions as n goes higher seems to increase, but 6x6 is
       an outlier, only having 4 solutions. Also, after going back and testing
       more solutions for 5x5, it has at least 5 solutions, which means 6 is
       definetely an outlier.
