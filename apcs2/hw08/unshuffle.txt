HW#8 -- Splitting n Mergin
2016-03-04

Base Case: If an array has one element, return it.
Recursive Step: Split the array into two arrays with half of the
elements each, and call the recursive function upon those two lists.
The final step is to order the lists against each other, going up a
level each time. This might require a helper function outside of
the recursive method.
