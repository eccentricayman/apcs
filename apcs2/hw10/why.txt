Much like binary searching, merge sort is O(n*log(n)). Both binary
search, merge sort splits the array into two halves multiple times;
the only difference is that the last step, merging the arrays until
one sorted array is achieved, has a runtime cost directly proportional
to the amount of elements in the list; known as n. This explains the
O(n*log(n)) runtime classification.
