HW#4 -- Knightly Exploration
2016-02-24

Since the knight can only move in so many directions based upon where
it starts, My algorithm starts off with the knight starting at the
top-left corner. A recursive function will be run for the knight, that
will check all the possible positions it can move to, and recursively
run the function starting from that position. At the beginning, it
check if the spot has already been touched by the knight. Since there
are only 8 directions a knight can move in at max, testing all the
possible places the knight can move can be hardcoded.

Ex. (Psuedo-Code)
if (col > 1 && row > 0 && _board[col - 2][row + 1] == 0) {
  //traverse board at col - 2, row - 1
}
//test 7 more times with all the other possible moves
