My idea revolves around following the right side of the wall, continuing to move until it can't.
This seemed to work upon testing, but integrating it would require a weird visualization of the
2D array.

After testing, this worked much better than my previous algorithm which involved having a counter for
the direction you would go in; once you hit a place where you couldn't move anymore, backtrack for n
spaces in the opposite direction of the way you were moving. The problem with this algorithm was that
if you needed to backtrack in more than one direction, it wouldn't store that information.
