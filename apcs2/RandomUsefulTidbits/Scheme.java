/***************************************
 * class Scheme
 * A rudimentary Scheme interpreter
 *
 * Algo:
 * 
 * 1. Eat some pancakes
 * 2. Parse with various functions
 * 3. Each opening parens triggers a function which calls other functions
 * based on the next operator to appear
 * 4. Function will return the value, and give it to the function above
 * 5. Eat your pancakes, this time with satisfaction as you uninstall 
 * DrRacket
 *
 * Stack of choice: ALStack by Ayman Ahmed
 *
 * b/c: ALStack doesn't need to traverse the entire list to reach an
 * index, and speed is maximum priority
