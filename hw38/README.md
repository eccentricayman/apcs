#GuessNumber

GuessNumber is a java class that chooses a random number from 1 to 100, and allows the user to guess a number, with the console telling the user whether they were too high or too low, and how many guesses it took when they reach the number. This also uses the Keyboard class from the cs1 package, to parse user input.
